Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0
Love the margaritas, too!	1
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
Wow... Loved this place.	1
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
I never come again.	0
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0
We loved the biscuits!!!	1
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	1
My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.	1
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	1
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	1
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
They dropped more than the ball.	0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
I love this place.	1
This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.	1
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.	1
- the food is rich so order accordingly.	1
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!	1
Both great!	1
After two I felt disgusting.	0
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.	1
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.	1
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.	1
Service was very prompt.	1
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.	1
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!	1
Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	1
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	1
I would not recommend this place.	0
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.	1
Food was average at best.	0
I'm not eating here!	0
Won't go back.	0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
Great food and awesome service!	1
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.	1
As for the service, I thought it was good.	1
Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!	1
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	1
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.	1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0
It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	0
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.	1
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0
The service was terrible though.	0
The service was extremely slow.	0
The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.	1
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1
Waitress was good though!	1
The food, amazing.	1
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
I won't be back.	0
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!	1
Went for lunch - service was slow.	0
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	1
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
Wow very spicy but delicious.	1
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
Will not be back!	0
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.	1
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	0
You won't be disappointed.	1
I had strawberry tea, which was good.	1
Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.	1
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!	1
Fantastic service here.	1
How awesome is that.	1
Would not go back.	0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1
An absolute must visit!	1
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
They were golden-crispy and delicious.	1
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
I really enjoyed Crema Caf√© before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.	1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.	1
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1
I did not expect this to be so good!	1
Sooooo good!!	1
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	0
Everything was perfect the night we were in.	1
This was like the final blow!	0
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
Worst martini ever!	0
I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.	1
I *heart* this place.	1
AN HOUR... seriously?	0
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0
A good time!	1
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1
Waitress was sweet and funny.	1
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	0
Very good lunch spot.	1
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	1
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.	1
Service was good and the company was better!	1
I just wanted to leave.	0
The kids play area is NASTY!	0
it was a drive to get there.	0
Best breakfast buffet!!!	1
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.	1
Great place fo take out or eat in.	1
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .	1
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	1
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).	1
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.	1
Don't waste your time here.	0
The food is very good for your typical bar food.	1
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.	1
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!	1
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!	1
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.	1
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0
The staff was very attentive.	1
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	1
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.	1
I love their fries and their beans.	1
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
I will not be eating there again.	0
Awesome selection of beer.	1
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
Best fish I've ever had in my life!	1
The atmosphere here is fun.	1
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	1
Great service and food.	1
Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!	1
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.	1
Will never, ever go back.	0
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1
Very very fun chef.	1
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).	1
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1
I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.	1
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
Very bad Experience!	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.	1
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!	1
The food was terrible.	0
It was way over fried.	0
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	1
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.	1
I will not return.	0
This one is simply a disappointment.	0
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	1
Those burgers were amazing.	1
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
Crust is not good.	0
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.	1
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
I've never been treated so bad.	0
We are so glad we found this place.	1
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
We will not be coming back.	0
I won't be back.	0
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1
What a great double cheeseburger!	1
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.	1
All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	1
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
The shrimp tender and moist.	1
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
Will be back again!	1
What a mistake that was!	0
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
The service was a bit lacking.	0
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
Now this dish was quite flavourful.	1
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!	1
Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	1
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.	1
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0
There was hardly any meat.	0
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.	1
Check it out.	1
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	1
Terrible service!	0
The service was poor and thats being nice.	0
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	1
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	1
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0
Hell no will I go back	0
Ambience is perfect.	1
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.	1
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.	1
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
I wouldn't return.	0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0
A great way to finish a great.	1
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
Must have been an off night at this place.	0
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	1
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".	0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	0
Def coming back to bowl next time	1
They know how to make them here.	1
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0
And then tragedy struck.	0
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	1
I consider this theft.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1
A great touch.	1
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	1
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!	1
Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.	1
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;	1
As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	1
The food wasn't good.	0
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.	1
I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.	1
Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	1
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1
Awful service.	0
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.	1
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	1
Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.	1
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0
We loved the place.	1
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.	1
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
For service, I give them no stars.	0
The portion was huge!	1
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.	1
I would not recommend this place.	0
Very, very sad.	0
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!	1
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
Cant say enough good things about this place.	1
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	0
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	1
- Really, really good rice, all the time.	1
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1
So they performed.	1
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	0
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!	1
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!	1
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.	1
Food was really boring.	0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
Tasted like dirt.	0
Their steaks are 100% recommended!	1
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	1
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.	1
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.	1
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1
He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	1
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	1
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
Reasonably priced also!	1
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1
But now I was completely grossed out.	0
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.	1
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
Would not recommend to others.	0
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	0
Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
The food was excellent and service was very good.	1
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	1
We won't be going back anytime soon!	0
This place is amazing!	1
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.	0
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1
The cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.	1
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
Soggy and not good.	0
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!	1
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
Fantastic food!	1
Ample portions and good prices.	1
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0
Sauce was tasteless.	0
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	1
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
Everything was fresh and delicious!	1
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0
As for the "mains," also uninspired.	0
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
I was seated immediately.	1
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
I had a pretty satifying experience.	1
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.	1
Their chow mein is so good!	1
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.	0
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1
The food was very good.	1
Thoroughly disappointed!	0
I think not again	0
very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
Weird vibe from owners.	0
Best tacos in town by far!!	1
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!	1
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.	1
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.	1
Which are small and not worth the price.	0
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!	1
Give it a try, you will be happy you did.	1
Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!	1
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
I'm super pissd.	0
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.	1
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.	1
I was so insulted.	0
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.	1
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
Total brunch fail.	0
Food was delicious!	1
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!	1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.	1
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.	1
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.	1
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
Food was great and so was the serivce!	1
The fried rice was dry as well.	0
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1
Overall, I like this place a lot.	1
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
did not like at all.	0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
We'd definitely go back here again.	1
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!	1
The warm beer didn't help.	0
I really enjoyed eating here.	1
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.	1
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1
Good food , good service .	1
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
It was awesome.	1
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.	1
We won't be returning.	0
And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.	1
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	1
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.	1
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1
No complaints!	1
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1
This is a GREAT place to eat!	1
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!	1
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0
It was not good.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
But I don't like it.	0
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!	1
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.	1
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
Once your food arrives it's meh.	0
I love this place.	1
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	1
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0

Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
The service was not up to par, either.	0
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
