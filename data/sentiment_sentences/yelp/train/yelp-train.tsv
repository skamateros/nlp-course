I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
The only downside is the service.	0
We'll never go again.	0
It was equally awful.	0
It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.	1
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.	1
Omelets are to die for!	1
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
If you're not familiar, check it out.	1
Pretty awesome place.	1
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.	0
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)	1
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0
Food was below average.	0
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
I hope this place sticks around.	1
first time there and might just be the last.	0
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.	1
Service is also cute.	1
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
I LOVED it!	1
The fries were great too.	1
It was pretty gross!	0
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
the presentation of the food was awful.	0
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.	1
dont go here.	0
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
I was mortified.	0
Not good for the money.	0
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	0
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.	1
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
Service is friendly and inviting.	1
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
You can't beat that.	1
Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.	1
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
Over rated.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.	1
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0
not even a "hello, we will be right with you."	0
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.	1
The Macarons here are insanely good.	1
I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.	1
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
All the bread is made in-house!	1
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.	1
Disappointing experience.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
I'd love to go back.	1
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
This place lacked style!!	0
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
Nice, spicy and tender.	1
This place was such a nice surprise!	1
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	1
For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.	1
I will be back many times soon.	1
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.	1
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.	1
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!	1
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
Con: spotty service.	0
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	1
I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!	1
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
Damn good steak.	1
What I really like there is the crepe station.	1
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.	1
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
It was just not a fun experience.	1
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0
Pretty cool I would say.	1
Owner's are really great people.!	1
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	0
Good value, great food, great service.	1
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.	1
Highly recommended.	1
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	0
The service was meh.	0
Worst Thai ever.	0
Spend your money elsewhere.	0
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	1
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	1
We were promptly greeted and seated.	1
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	1
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1
The RI style calamari was a joke.	0
The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.	0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0
The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
He was terrible!	0
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	1
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0
The Burrittos Blah!	0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
Great food.	1
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	1
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
Good prices.	1
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.	0
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	1
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1
-My order was not correct.	0
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
Don't do it!!!!	0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	1
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.	0
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
Overall, I like there food and the service.	1
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!	1
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
But the service was beyond bad.	0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	1
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	0
will definitely be back!	1
The selection of food was not the best.	0
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.	1
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1
The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.	1
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.	0
Very good food, great atmosphere.1	1
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	1
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.	1
Best tater tots in the southwest.	1
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!	1
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.	1
Spend your money and time some place else.	0
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	1
Everything was gross.	0
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
The block was amazing.	1
Penne vodka excellent!	1
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!	1
I'll definitely be in soon again.	1
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	1
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1
Terrible management.	0
Never going back.	0
Overall, a great experience.	1
Nargile - I think you are great.	1
I've had better atmosphere.	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
The waitress and manager are so friendly.	1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	1
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.	1
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	1
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
I promise they won't disappoint.	1
I give it 2 thumbs down	0
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".	0
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.	1
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
What a mistake.	0
That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.	1
The food came out at a good pace.	1
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
Overpriced for what you are getting.	0
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	1
They were excellent.	1
Everything was good and tasty!	1
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0
Interesting decor.	1
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!	1
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1
2 Thumbs Up!!	1
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
Pretty good beer selection too.	1
Waiter was a jerk.	0
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.	0
Bacon is hella salty.	1
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.	1
The ambiance was incredible.	1
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
Very friendly staff.	1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.	1
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!	1
very tough and very short on flavor!	0
In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.	1
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.	1
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.	1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	1
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	0
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
They really want to make your experience a good one.	1
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
Service is quick and friendly.	1
Very good, though!	1
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.	1
Nice ambiance.	1
Awesome service and food.	1
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
We won't be going back.	0
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.	1
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.	1
There is nothing authentic about this place.	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
Boy was that sucker dry!!.	0
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	1
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
After one bite, I was hooked.	1
The desserts were a bit strange.	0
Will not be back.	0
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.	1
Food arrived quickly!	1
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0
The food was terrible.	0
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !	1
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.	1
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.	1
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
Very poor service.	0
The food is good.	1
Food was so gooodd.	1
Great pork sandwich.	1
Service stinks here!	0
It is worth the drive.	1
Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!	1
And it was way to expensive.	0
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0
We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	1
Do not waste your money here!	0
I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.	1
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	0
They have a really nice atmosphere.	1
The pizza selections are good.	1
The management is rude.	0
The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1
The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.	1
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	1
Waited and waited and waited.	0
It was absolutely amazing.	1
I would recommend saving room for this!	1
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
Very disappointing!!!	0
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.	1
Not my thing.	0
The ambiance isn't much better.	0
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	1
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
I'm so happy to be here!!!"	1
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	1
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
But then they came back cold.	0
Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.	0
Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.	1
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.	1
This is a good joint.	1
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
Great Pizza and Salads!	1
this place is good.	1
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
It was delicious!!!	1
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
The manager was the worst.	0
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1
Won't ever go here again.	0
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.	1
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	1
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	1
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	0
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.	1
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.	1
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	1
Eclectic selection.	1
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.	1
These were so good we ordered them twice.	1
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1
Everyone is treated equally special.	1
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.	1
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.	1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.	1
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
The service here is fair at best.	0
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.	0
Mediocre food.	0
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.	1
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.	1
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1
Appetite instantly gone.	0
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.	1
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	1
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.	1
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!	1
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0
They have great dinners.	1
You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.	1
Go To Place for Gyros.	1
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
Left very frustrated.	0
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.	1
Good Service-check!	1
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	1
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0
The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.	1
Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.	1
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.	1
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
Service sucks.	0
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.	1
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
OMG, the food was delicioso!	1
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.	1
So absolutley fantastic.	1
Service was fantastic.	1
I waited and waited.	0
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.	1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1
And service was super friendly.	1
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	1
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.	0
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	1
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.	1
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.	1
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
Nothing special.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
This is a disgrace.	0
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.	1
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.	1
The patio seating was very comfortable.	1
This place deserves no stars.	0
To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	1
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.	1
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	1
Great brunch spot.	1
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.	1
This place has it!	1
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
This place is disgusting!	0
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
It was packed!!	0
DELICIOUS!!	1
definitely will come back here again.	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	1
Avoid at all cost!	0
I probably won't be coming back here.	0
