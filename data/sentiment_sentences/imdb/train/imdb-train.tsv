Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  	0
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	1

I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  	1
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  	0
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  	0
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	1
Also great directing and photography.  	1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  	1
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	0
In a word, it is embarrassing.  	0
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	0
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  	0

The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  	1
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  	0
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  	0
The results, well, are a shame.  	0
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1

So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  	0
The dialogue sucked.  	0
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	1
And I really did find them funny.  	1
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  	1

All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  	0
Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  	0
He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire.  	1
However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  	1
Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  	0
Of course, the acting is blah.  	0
Horrible!  	0
The poor actors.  	0
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
& That movie was bad.  	0
Nothing at all to recommend.  	0
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  	1
A standout scene.  	1
Everything about it is just bad.  	0
Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  	1
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  	1
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  	0
If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	1
In short, don't bother with this movie.  	0
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  	0
I liked it.  	1
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	1
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  	1
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  	0
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  	1
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  	0
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  	0
I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  	1
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	1
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0
Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
;) Recommend with confidence!  	1
At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  	1
10 out of 10 stars.  	1
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  	0
Omit watching this.  	0
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  	0
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0
It even has its sweet moments.  	1
Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  	0
I enjoyed it.  	1
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  	0
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  	1
An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.  	1
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  	1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
Not easy to watch.  	0
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  	0
Excellent performance.  	1
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  	0
Avoid at ALL costs!  	0
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  	0
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  	1
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
One of the worst shows of all time.  	0
It's a sad movie, but very good.  	1
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it.  	1
This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  	1
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  	0
It really created a unique feeling though.  	1
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  	0
The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  	1
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  	1
Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  	0
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  	0
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	0
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  	0
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  	0
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  	0
A bit predictable.  	0
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1
It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella "The Dead.  	1
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  	1
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1
Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  	0
Then the film just dropped the ball.  	0
The transfers are very good.  	1
Not even good for camp value!  	0
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  	0
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0
This movie has a cutting edge to it.  	1
Highly unrecommended.  	0
An excellent performance from Ms.  	1
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  	1
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  	1
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  	1
If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  	0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  	1
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  	1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  	1
She carries the movie well.  	1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  	1
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  	1
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  	0
Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  	1
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  	0
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  	0
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	0
All things considered, a job very well done.  	1
Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  	1
This is an excellent film.  	1
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	0
I thought it was bad.  	0
I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  	0
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  	1
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.  	1
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	1
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  	0
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	1
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  	0
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  	0
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  	1
Awful.  	0
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  	1
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  	1
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  	1
Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  	1
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  	0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	1
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  	0
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  	1
I hate movies like that.  	0
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  	1
But I thought his acting was skilled.  	1
But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	1
So bad...well...it's just bad.  	0
After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  	1
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  	1
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1
Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  	0
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  	0
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  	0
