I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  	1
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  	0
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  	0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
All of the main players are mesmerising.  	1
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	1
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  	1
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  	1
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  	1
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	1
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	1
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  	0
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  	1
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
Very little music or anything to speak of.  	0
The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  	1
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  	0
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  	0
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  	0
VERY funny!  	1
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	0
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	0
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	0
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  	0
And those baby owls were adorable.  	1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1
The film looks cheap and bland.  	0
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
The problem was the script.  	0
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
Babie Bop is very cute.  	1
The story line is totally predictable.  	0
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  	0
Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  	0
Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  	0
I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  	1
You can find better movies at youtube.  	0
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  	1
Not recommended.  	0
Either way, it sucks.  	0
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	0
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  	1
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  	1
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  	0
As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  	0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  	0
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  	1
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	1
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  	0
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  	0

Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  	1
Then, there's the plot holes.  	0
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	1
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  	0
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  	0
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
DELETE this film from your mind!  	0
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  	0
Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  	0
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1
I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  	1
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1
Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  	0
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  	1
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  	0
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  	0
Don't miss it.  	1
I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  	0
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  	0
But it's just not funny.  	0
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	0
I just saw this film and I recommend it.  	1
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  	0
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  	0
Waste your money on this game.  	1
The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  	1
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1
The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  	1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
I wasn't the least bit interested.  	0
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  	1
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  	0
It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  	0
I have recommended it to friends.  	1
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  	0
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	0
Lots of holes in the script.  	0
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  	1
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  	0
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  	0
The budget was evidently very limited.  	0
Regrettably, the film fails.  	0
A great film by a great director.  	1
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	0
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  	0
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  	1
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  	1
It is not good.  	0
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  	1
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1
"You'll love it!  	1
The directing is sloppy at best.  	0
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  	1
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  	0
I liked this movie way too much.  	1
Hitchcock is a great director.  	1
Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1
This film offers many delights and surprises.  	1
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  	0
If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  	0
This game rocks.  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  	0
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  	0
The visual effects were AWFUL.  	0
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  	0
This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  	1
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  	0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  	1
Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  	1
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.  	1
Do not waste your time.  	0
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.  	0
Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  	1
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	0
Simply beautiful.  	1
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	0
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	1
It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1
Camerawork - again, bad.  	0
No plot whatsoever!  	0
) Don't waste your time.  	0
Hated it.  	0
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  	1
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  	0
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  	1
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  	1
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  	0
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  	1
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  	0
This is such a fun and funny movie.  	1
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	0
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	1
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  	1
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  	1
Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  	1
It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  	0
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  	1
The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	1
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	1
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  	0
Today the graphics are crap.  	0
There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	1
It is shameful.  	0
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  	1
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  	1
In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  	1
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	1
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1
GO AND SEE IT!  	1
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	0
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	1
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  	0
" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  	1
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  	1
It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	1
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  	0
Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  	1
The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.  	1
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0
You won't forget this movie!  	1
Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	1
Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  	1
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  	1
A film not easily forgotten.  	1
An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  	1
The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  	0
He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  	0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	0
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  	1
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  	1
Great movie!  	1
Conclusion - I loved it.  	1
I never walked out of a movie faster.  	0
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  	1
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	1
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  	0
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	0
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  	0
He's a national treasure.  	1
Filmiing was less expansive.  	0
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  	1
His performance is simply genius.  	1
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	1
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  	0
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  	0
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  	1
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  	1
The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  	1
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1
When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  	1
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  	1
Lange had become a great actress.  	1
Totally believable.  	1
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  	0
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  	0
The acting sucked.  	0
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	1
Ray Charles is legendary.  	1
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  	1
I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  	0
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  	0
Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  	1
It deserves strong love.  	1
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  	1
" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  	1
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	0
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  	0
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
It was so funny.  	1
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  	1
She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  	1
In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  	0
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  	1
10/10  	1
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	1
I paid too much.  	0
there is no real plot.  	0
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  	0
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  	1
The lead man is charisma-free.  	0
It is an insane game.  	1
The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	1
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  	0
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  	0
That was done in the second movie.  	0
How awful she is!  	0
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  	0
It's just painful!  	0
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  	0
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	0
If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  	1
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  	1
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  	0
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  	0
This movie is BAD.  	0
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  	0
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  	1
She's poised and amazing.  	1
is pretty funny.  	1
It is a really good show to watch.  	1
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	1
Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  	0
It was also the right balance of war and love.  	1
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  	1
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  	0
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  	0
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  	0
It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  	1
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  	0
I rather enjoyed it.  	1
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	1
This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  	1
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  	0
Again, lame.  	0
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  	0
This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  	1
This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  	0
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  	1
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  	1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	1
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  	1
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	0
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  	1
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  	0
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  	1
Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  	1
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	0
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  	0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  	0
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  	0
Excellent short film.  	1
The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  	0
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  	0
The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  	0
I'll even say it again  this is torture.  	0
Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  	0
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  	0
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  	0
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  	1
Avoid at all costs.  	0
Nothing new there.  	0
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  	0
It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  	1
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  	0
I gave it a 10  	1
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  	1
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  	0
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  	1
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  	1
I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  	1
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  	0
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  	0
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  	1
The least said about the acting the better.  	0
A good film by a great director!  	1
The acting was bad.  	0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
The directing seems too pretentious.  	0
The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  	1
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  	0
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  	1
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  	0
It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  	1
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  	0
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	0
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  	0
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  	0
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	0
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  	0
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	1
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  	0
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  	0
Give this one a look.  	1
Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  	1
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  	0
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  	0
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  	0
The character developments also lacked in depth.  	0
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  	0
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  	1
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	1
The cast is good.  	1
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  	0
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1
Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  	1
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
The cast is always entertaining as usual.  	1
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  	1
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	0
Go watch it!  	1
The story line is just awful!  	0
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  	0
10/10  	1
Brilliance indeed.  	1
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  	0
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  	1
Even worse than Ticker!  	0
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  	0
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  	0
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  	1
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  	0
A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  	1
Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	1
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  	0
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  	1
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  	1
Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  	1
Exceptionally bad!  	0
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  	0
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  	1
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  	0
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  	1
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  	1
Overall, a delight!  	1
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  	1
This is a stunning movie.  	1
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  	0
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	1
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  	0
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  	1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	1
Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  	1
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  	0
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  	0
This movie is terrible.  	0
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  	1
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  	0
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	1
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  	1
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	1
They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  	1
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  	0
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	1
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  	0
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	1
Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  	0
See it.  	1
Everything stinks.  	0
They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
Definitely worth checking out.  	1
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  	0
Very disappointing.  	0
The film is way too long.  	0
This is just a great movie.  	1
I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  	0
Definitely worth checking out.  	1
Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  	0
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  	0
This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  	1
But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  	1
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  	0
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  	0
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  	0
Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  	1
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	0
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  	0
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	1
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  	1
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  	0
The lighting is awful.  	0
There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  	0
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  	0
Everything is appalling.  	0
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  	0
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
There are some generally great things in it.  	1
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1
The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  	0
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  	0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  	0
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  	0
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  	1
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	1
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  	0
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  	0
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  	0
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  	1
A Lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... FOREVER.  	0
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  	1
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  	0
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  	1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	0
I came out of it feeling angry.  	0
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  	1
The rest of the cast also play well.  	1
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  	1
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  	1
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  	0
The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  	1
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0
The worst one of the series.  	0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  	0
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	1
