Piece of Junk.	0
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"	0
Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.	0
O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.	1
It's AGGRAVATING!	0
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.	1
The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.	1
Worked great!.	1
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.	1
But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.	0
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.	0
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.	0
Reception is terrible and full of static.	0
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.	0
After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	0
Very easy to use.	1
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.	0
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	1
It has been a winner for us.	1
Unreliable - I'm giving up.	0
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.	1
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).	0
Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.	0
This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.	1
Restored my phone to like new performance.	1
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement	0
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.	0
This is a great phone!.	1
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	1
stay away from this store, be careful.	0
And none of the tones is acceptable.	0
Good audio quality.	1
Doesn't Work.	0
I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.	1
This phone works great.	1
bad fit, way too big.	0
The mic is great.	1
I'm a bit disappointed.	0
Could not get strong enough signal.	0
Improper description.... I had to return it.	0
I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.	1
what a disappointment	0
In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?	1
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.	0
Happy so far!.	1
Great bluetooth!.	1
WORTHWHILE.	1
very good product, well made.	1
Has been working great.	1
Worst Customer Service Ever.	0
This case seems well made.	1
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.	1
It also had a new problem.	0
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.	1
The instruction manual is lacking.	0
Made very sturdy.	1
Good product - incredible value.	1
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.	0
This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.	1
This is a great deal.	1
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.	0
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	1
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.	1
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!	1
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.	1
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.	1
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.	0
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.	0
I wouldn't recommend buying this product.	0
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.	0
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.	0
Last time buying from you.	0
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.	1
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.	0
$50 Down the drain.	0
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.	1
During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.	0
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.	0
These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.	1
The case is great and works fine with the 680.	1
I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.	1
It is simple to use and I like it.	1
It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.	1
Great Earpiece.	1
Saggy, floppy piece of junk.	0
I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.	1
Thank you for wasting my money.	0
Worst customer service.	0
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.	0
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!	1
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.	0
I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.	1
It does everything the description said it would.	1
Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!	1
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.	0
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.	1
THey are so cool!	1
Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.	0
So just beware.	0
This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!	1
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.	1
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.	1
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	0
Plan on ordering from them again and again.	1
It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.	0
Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	1
All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.	0
It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.	1
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.	0
Battery charge-life is quite long.	1
No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	1
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.	0
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.	1
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).	0
I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.	1
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.	1
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!	0
Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.	0
Portable and it works.	1
Will order from them again!	1
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.	0
Very good phone.	1
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	0
The reception has been generally good.	1
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.	0
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.	1
This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	1
I am more than happy with this product.	1
This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.	0
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	1
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.	0
Soyo technology sucks.	0
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	0
Great Value.	1
This is a great deal.	1
My sister has one also and she loves it.	1
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory	0
You won't regret it!	1
Bad Quality.	0
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.	0
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.	1
Nice solid keyboard.	1
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.	0
Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.	0
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	0
jabra ear gels "R" the best!.	1
All three broke within two months of use.	0
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.	1
Good transmit audio.	1
However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	0
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.	1
Couldn't figure it out	0
Don't bother - go to the store.	0
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.	0
Excellent sound quality.	1
Great for iPODs too.	1
Linked to my phone without effort.	1
I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.	0
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!	1
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.	0
Does not fit.	0
I'm pleased.	1
It felt too light and "tinny.".	0
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.	0
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.	0
Excellent product for the price.	1
I am glad I purchased it.	1
Fantastic earphones.	1
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.	0
I was not happy with this item.	0
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.	0
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.	0
How stupid is that?	0
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	0
I'm trying to return it for a refund.	0
every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.	1
The BT headset was such a disapoinment.	0
Great phone!.	1
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.	1
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.	0
Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	1
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.	0
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.	0
However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.	0
Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.	1
It's a great item.	1
Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!	0
Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.	1
wont work right or atleast for me.	0
Very satisifed with that.	1
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.	1
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.	1
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.	0
It has kept up very well.	1
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	1
No buyers remorse on this one!.	0
For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.	0
AMAZON SUCKS.	0
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.	0
Sprint charges for this service.	0
This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.	1
Worked perfectly!	1
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.	1
The item received was Counterfeit.	0
I wasted my little money with this earpiece.	0
It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.	0
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.	1
The battery life is highly unacceptable.	0
But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.	1
It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.	1
I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything.	0
Works great!.	1
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	1
Very much disappointed with this company.	0
I Was Hoping for More.	0
The iGo chargers and tips are really great.	1
Not enough volume.	0
Waste of 13 bucks.	0
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1
Awkward to use and unreliable.	0
Those phones are working just fine now.	1
fast service.	1
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.	1
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.	1
Great Pocket PC / phone combination.	1
I would highly recommend this product.	1
I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .	1
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.	1
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.	0
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.	1
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!	0
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.	1
Rip off---- Over charge shipping.	0
Poor product.	0
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.	0
This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.	1
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.	0
I don't like this Nokia either.	0
I want my money back.	0
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.	1

good protection and does not make phone too bulky.	1
The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.	1
Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.	0
Reversible plug works great.	1
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	0
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.	0
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	1
Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.	0
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.	0
It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.	0
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.	1
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.	0
No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.	0
very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.	1
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.	1
Not a good bargain.	0
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	1
My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.	0
The pleather case doesn't fit.	0

Voice recognition is tremendous!	1
Great product for the price!.	1
Phone falls out easily.	0

My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!	0
Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.	1
Waste of money.	0
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.	1
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.	0
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.	0
Excellent bluetooth headset.	1
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.	1
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.	0
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!	0
Looks great and is strong."	1
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.	0
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	1
You get what you pay for I guess.	0
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!	1
Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	1
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.	1
It was a great phone.	1
Good case, Excellent value.	1
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.	0
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.	1
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.	0
I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.	1
Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.	1
poor quality and service.	0
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.	0
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.	0
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.	0
Excellent product for the price.	1
Better Than New.	1
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.	0
The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.	0
Great Product.	1
The noise shield is incrediable.	1
Very good stuff for the price.	1
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.	0
Horrible, horrible protector.	0
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.	1
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.	0
It didn't charge for me.	0
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.	0
The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.	1
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.	0
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.	0
That company is a joke.	0
As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.	0

Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.	0
BT50 battery junk!.	0
Nice design and quality.	1
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	1

Item Does Not Match Picture.	0

don't waste your money.	0
This item is fantastic and works perfectly!	1
Doesn't hold charge.	0
Good product, good seller.	1

Battery has no life.	0
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS	0
I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).	1

Great product.	1
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.	1

cool phone.	1
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	0
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)	0
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."	1
Don't buy this product - It fails!.	0
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.	0
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!	0
Incredible!.	1
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.	0
Gets the job done.	1
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.	1
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.	0
Works great.	1
Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.	0
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.	0
I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.	1
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.	0

If there is a wind, it is completely useless.	0
Very Displeased.	0
Excellent starter wireless headset.	0
Terrible phone holder.	0
I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	1
It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.	1
So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.	0
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.	1
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	0
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.	0
Great case and price!	1
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.	0
Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.	0
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.	1
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.	0
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.	1
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.	1
The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.	1
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.	0
The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.	1
Works good.	1
Please dont waste your money.	0
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.	0
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	1
I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.	1
When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.	0
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0
It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.	0
The battery works great!	1
I highly recommend this device to everyone!	1
Jawbone Era is awesome too!	1

The buttons for on and off are bad.	0
Nice docking station for home or work.	1

Not worth it.	0
Its the best headset I have used.	1
Comfortable in my hand.	1

)Setup couldn't have been simpler.	1
Great price, too!	1
Great software for Motorolas.	1
I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.	0
I'm still infatuated with this phone.	1
Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.	1
Nice Sound.	1
Nice case, feels good in your hands.	1
Perfect for the PS3.	1
Great phone.	1
Thank you for such great service.	1
Doesn't do the job.	0
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.	1
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.	0
