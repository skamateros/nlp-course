A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.	1
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.	1
Good Quality.	1
None of it works, just don't buy it.	0
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.	1
A Disappointment.	0
It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.	1
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.	0
Good show, Samsung.	1
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.	0
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.	1
Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.	0
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!	0
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.	0
This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.	0
The construction of the headsets is poor.	0
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.	1
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.	0
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.	0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.	0
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	1
Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.	1
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!	1
It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).	0
Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	0
Also makes it easier to hold on to.	1
Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.	1
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good	0
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.	0
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended	1
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.	0
Buttons are too small.	0
Kind of flops around.	0
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	0
Low Quality.	0
I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.	0
Excellent!.	1
Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.	1
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..	1
Lousy product.	0
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!	0
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.	0
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.	1
the phone was unusable and was not new.	0
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.	0
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.	0
I love this thing!	1
I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.	0
The phone loads super!	1
Really good product.	1
This fixes all the problems.	1
Do not make the same mistake as me.	0
Disappointed!.	0
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.	0
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.	0
I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.	0
Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.	0
It was quite comfortable in the ear.	1
I highly recommend this case.	1
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.	0
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.	0
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.	1
(It works!)	1
Better than expected.	1
Just what I wanted.	1
WELL IM SATISFIED.	1
Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.	1
Worst ever.	0
An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.	1
Very wind-resistant.	1
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.	1
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.	1
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.	0
Poorly contstruct hinge.	0
Bad Choice.	0
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.	0
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	1
I would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
Very good quality though	1
Price is good too.	1
When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.	0
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.	1
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.	1
The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.	1
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.	0
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.	0
Basically the service was very bad.	0
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.	0
A must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design.	0
As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.	0
Freezes frequently4.	0
Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.	1
I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.	1
So Far So Good!.	1
What a waste of money and time!.	0
I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.	1
No real improvement.	0
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.	0
Buy a different phone - but not this.	0
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.	1
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.	1
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.	0
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.	1
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.	1
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.	1
It worked very well.	1
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).	0
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.	1
Unfortunately it did not work.	0
The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.	1
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	0
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!	0
Very Dissapointing Performance.	0
I would recommend it.	1
The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.	1
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.	0
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.	0
you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.	1
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	1
If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.	0
Good case!.	1
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.	0
disappointed.	0
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.	0
After charging overnight, these batteries work great.	1
The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.	0
worthless product.	0
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0
Just does not work.	0
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	1
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	0
VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.	0
Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.	0
but it is great, i would really recommend it	1
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.	0
Its reception is very very poor.	0
This is infuriating.	0
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.	0
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	1
The battery runs down quickly.	0
Does everything it should and more.	1
Disapointing Results.	0
Truly awful.	0
Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !	1
Really pleased with this product so far.	1
Big Disappointment with calendar sync.	0
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.	0
They refuse to refund or replace.	0
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.	0
I love this bluetooth!	1
I only hear garbage for audio.	0
Works for me.	1
My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.	0
One of my favorite purchases ever.	1
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	0
Absolutely great.	1
This battery is an excellent bargain!	1
Setup went very smoothly.	1
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.	0
Don't waste your $$$ on this one.	0
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.	0
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...	0
disappointing.	0
I love this device.	1
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.	1
!I definitly recommend!!	1
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.	1
Same problem as others have mentioned.	0
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!	1
I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1
best bluetooth on the market.	1
I am also very happy with the price.	1
Iam very pleased with my purchase.	1
Better than you'd expect.	1
I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.	1
It doesn't make you look cool.	0
The design is very odd, as the ear "clip" is not very comfortable at all.	0
doesn't last long.	0
Excellent product.	1
Beautiful styling though.	1
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.	0
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.	1
Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.	1
I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.	0
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.	0
The ear buds only play music in one ear.	0
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	1
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	1
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.	1
Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.	0
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.	0
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	1
The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.	0
#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.	1
Battery life is also great!	1
The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.	0
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	1
It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.	0
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.	1
don't waste your money and time.	0
NOT WHAT I WANTED.	0
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!	1
Not impressed.	0
The best phone in market :).	1

A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.	0
Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.	1
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.	0
Defective crap.	0
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.	0
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	1
Don't buy this product.	0
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.	1
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.	0
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.	0
Cant get the software to work with my computer.	0
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.	0
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.	1
Poor Construction.	0
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!	1
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.	1
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.	0
Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.	1
Plug was the wrong size.	0
Terrible product, and waste of money!	0
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.	1
Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.	1
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	1
The "1.2" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.	1
This device is great in several situations:1.)	1
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.	0
I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.	0
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!	0
very disappointed.	0
The reception is excellent!	1
Don't buy this product.	0
It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.	1
Does Not Work.	0
Its a total package.	1
Timely shipment and quality product.	1
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.	0
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!	0
Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.	0
It looks very nice.	1
REALLY UGLY.	0
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!	1
2 thumbs up to this seller	1
I great reception all the time.	1
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.	0
I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.	1
Customer service was terrible.	0
My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.	1
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.	0
Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).	0
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.	1
I found this product to be waaay too big.	0
Good , works fine.	1
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.	0
Magical Help.	1
I also didn't like the "on" button, it felt like it would crack with use.	0
It definitely was not as good as my S11.	1
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.	0
They do not care about the consumer one bit.	0
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.	0
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.	0
Battery lasts only a few hours.	0
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.	1
Great product and price.	1
THAT one didn't work either.	0
I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.	0
Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.	1
Good price.	1
However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.	0
IT'S REALLY EASY.	1
Bad Purchase.	0
I would highly recommend this.	1
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.	0
SWEETEST PHONE!!!	1
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.	0
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.	1
Definitely a bargain.	1
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.	0
Avoid this one if you can.	0
The sound quality is excellent as well.	1
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.	1
It's not what it says it is.	0
However I needed some better instructions.	0
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.	0
Worth every penny.	1
Pretty piece of junk.	0
Works fine.	1
First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.	0
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!	0
Simple, lightweight and great fit.	1

Talk about USELESS customer service.	0
WORST PHONE EVER.	0
Having trouble with volume.	0
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	0
great headset, very impressed - H500.	1
The shipping time was also very quick!	1
Bad Reception.	0
The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.	1
I got it because it was so small and adorable.	1
Provides good protection and looks classy, too.	1
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.	0
Disappointed with battery.	0
The commercials are the most misleading.	0
The delivery was on time.	1
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.	1
Excellent dual-purpose headset.	1
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.	0
Don't buy it.	0
Horrible phone.	0
Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.	0

Great phone!.	1
They work about 2 weeks then break.	0

Earbud piece breaks easily.	0
What a waste of time!	0
Cumbersome design.	0
The accompanied software is almost brilliant.	1
Works great.	1
Product is exactly as described.	1
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	1
My headset works just peachy-keen.	1
We would recommend these to others.	1
Design Flaw?.	0
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).	0
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1
I'm returning them.	0
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.	0
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.	0
Would recommend this item.	1
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	1
It was a waste of my money.	0
Don't waste your money!.	0
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.	0
Exactly what I wanted.	1
But now that it is "out of warranty" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.	0
It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.	1
It is a joy to use.	1
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	0
The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.	1
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.	0
Razr Battery - Good buy.	1
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	1
It was horrible!.	0
I especially love the long battery life.	1
The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.	1
Awsome Device Works Great!!.	1
This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	0
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.	1
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.	0
I received it quickly and it works great!!	1
Stay Away From the Q!.	0
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.	1
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!	0
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.	0
Great Phone.	1
I am very happy	1
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.	1
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is	1
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!	0
All in all I think it was a good investment.	1
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.	0
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	0
First of all, it doesn't wear well.	0
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.	1
The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.	0
Excellent wallet type phone case.	1
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.	0
Comfort for our whole family.	1
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.	0
Love This Phone.	1
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	1
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!	1
Krussel Always good.	1
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.	1
Don't make the same mistake I did.	0
Very disappointing.	0
I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.	0
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.	1
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.	0
I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.	0
It is very comfortable on the ear.	1
Everything about this product is wrong.First	0
Very happy with this product.	1
Lasted one day and then blew up.	0
Poor sound quality.	0
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.	0
New Battery works great in phone.	1
This one works and was priced right.	1
Five star Plus, plus.	1
Great choice!	1
Keep up the good work Amazon!!	1
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.	1
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0
lightweight and works well.	1
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!	1
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).	1
Excellent hands free tool.	1
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.	0
Audio Quality is poor, very poor.	0
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.	0
Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	1
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.	0
Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.	0
I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.	1
This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	0
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	1
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.	0
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.	1
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.	0
I'm very disappointed with my decision.	0
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.	0
And I just love the colors!	1
Nice headset priced right.	1
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	1
That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.	1
useless phone, simply deaf.	0
The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.	0
Were JERKS on the phone.	0
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.	0
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.	0
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	0
Painful on the ear.	0
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.	0
Love it.. Great armband.	1
Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.	1
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.	0
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.	1
So far it has worked like a charm.	1
Dont waste your money...	0
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.	0
Love this headset!	1
The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.	1
Great charger.	1
Very prompt service.	1
We are sending it back.	0
Great sound and service.	1
Was not happy.	0
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.	1
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	0
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).	0
Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.	1
camera color balance is AWFUL.	0
I would recommend this.	1
Now I know that I made a wise decision.	1
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.	0
Easy to use.	1
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.	0
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	1
Absolutel junk.	0
Very pleased with this headset.	1
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.	1
Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.	1
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.	1
I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.	1
Great for using with your home stereo.	1
I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.	1
much better than the hard plastic cases.	1
Great Phone.	1
A pretty good product.	1
Warning - Stay away.	0
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	0
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.	1
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.	1
Sprint - terrible customer service.	0
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.	0
This is a beautiful phone.	1
I would have given no star if I was able.	0
It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.	1
